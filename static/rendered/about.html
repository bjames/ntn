<p>My name is Brandon James and I am a Network Engineer in Fort Worth, TX. Before I was all in on Networking, I worked for a Managed Services company where, in addition to networking, I worked with virtualization, storage, Windows and Linux servers, along with a bit of desktop support. I’m also a graduate from Texas Tech University where I studied Economics and minored in Computer Science. To this day, I maintain a strong interest in Computer Science which has a direct impact in the way I approach networking topics.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I’m a father of a 10-month old boy, husband, dog owner, trail runner and wannabe landscape/wildlife/family photographer. On top of all that, I also consider NTN one of my hobbies. I only write about topics that I feel like writing about and only when I feel like writing. Admittedly this is something I work on pretty regularly, but many of my articles never see the light of day.</p>
