My name is Brandon James and I am a Network Engineer in Fort Worth, TX. Before I was all in on Networking, I worked for a Managed Services company where, in addition to networking, I worked with virtualization, storage, Windows and Linux servers, along with a bit of desktop support. I’m also a graduate from Texas Tech University where I studied Economics and minored in Computer Science. To this day, I maintain a strong interest in Computer Science which has a direct impact in the way I approach networking topics.

Outside of work, I’m a father of a 10-month old boy, husband, dog owner, trail runner and wannabe landscape/wildlife/family photographer. On top of all that, I also consider NTN one of my hobbies. I only write about topics that I feel like writing about and only when I feel like writing. Admittedly this is something I work on pretty regularly, but many of my articles never see the light of day.

# NTN

I actually purchased neverthenetwork.com back in 2017, but I didn't really do anything with it other than put together a simple javascript subnet calculator. You can see what the pre-2019 iteration of NTN looked like on [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20180815153506/https://neverthenetwork.com/). Initially NTN was not going to be a blog, it was only going to feature networking tools, like those found in the [tools section](https://neverthenetwork.com/tools) of the website. In June 2019, I started teaching myself [flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) and began piecing together some of the tools that I had planned. During this process, I decided to also create NTN Notes, which the technical blog you see when you first hit the site. 

I've also recently made the [github project public](https://github.com/bjames/ntn). If you are interested in learning how NTN works on the back-end, github is probably the best place to do so.
